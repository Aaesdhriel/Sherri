		<h2>Diversity</h2>
		<p>
	Diversity is inherent to human experience. It is important to embrace and share our diversity in order to
	   develop a more comprehensive understanding of our fellow man. As a survivor of childhood abuse and neglect, I am sensitive to 
	   issues of diversity in academia and look to incorporate a range of diverse perspectives in every academic discussion. Working 
	   with young people from communities that have been historically underrepresented in academia has given me access to a host of 
	   untempered voices boasting unique insights. I actively incorporate these insights into my professional and personal teaching and writing.

		<h4>Description</h4>
	
		Advocacy is the active support of a cause through argumentation. Advocacy plays a role in the political process whereby 
		we encourage others to reconsider the current state of affairs
		in favor of a more just society. Advocacy also play a role in social services whereby we encourage 
		disadvantaged individuals to connect with available resources in order to increase 
standards of living and quality of life. My work as an advocate emphasizes both approaches.

		<h4>Description</h4>
		As a teacher, it is my responsibility to anticipate and respond to the diverse needs of students in my 
		community who are impacted by a variety of experiences. To equip myself for effectively managing a classroom, 
		I build on my knowledge of diversity both in the United States and abroad. Generally, my emphasis is improved educational 
		outcomes for individuals from underserved populations, especially for survivors of child abuse and neglect: an issue that 
		tracks my personal experiences. Specifically, my goal is to teach the skills necessary for knowledge acquisition and 
		dissemination in any environment.

		<h4>Description</h4>
		Cross-cultural experience is a two-way street. Through living and travelling abroad, I have had the opportunity to appreciate other cultures 
		as well as come to understand the core values in my own culture. It is crucial that we learn how to view our experiences through the 
		lenses of other perspectives in order to grow as a culturally aware citizen of the world. It is similarly important that we learn how to incorporate 
		these perspectives into our teaching, writing, and daily interactions. For these reasons, I have travelled to 22 countries and conducted research in 
		international settings. Further, I have worked in disadvantaged communities in the United States to broaden my cultural awareness within my own country.

	<!-- <p>Higher education is notoriously devoid of diversity. 
However, diversity is the source of alternate perspectives, innovation, and creative insights.
Institutions that lack diversity ultimately lack these tremendous resources.  
  Recognizing a serious loss, many institutions and academic departments across the US are implementing programs to increase campus diversity.
