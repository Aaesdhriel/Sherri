		<h2>You found me!</h2>
	
	
		<p>
			I am a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.philosophy.ucsb.edu/people/profiles/graduate-students/conklin.html" target="_blank">Department of Philosophy</a> at 
			the University of California Santa Barbara. 
	  My current research focus is Ethics, especially Moral Worth and Moral Psychology. 
	  The tentative title of my PhD dissertation is "Responsibility without Blame." 
	  Prior to joining UCSB, I earned my MSc by Research in Philosophy from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland under the supervision 
	  of Elinor Mason.
My dissertation was called "Philosophical Problems with Praise-Blame Asymmetry."
