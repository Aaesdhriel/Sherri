		<h2>Advocacy</h2>
		<p>
		Advocacy is the active support of a cause through argumentation. Advocacy plays a role in the political process whereby 
		we encourage others to reconsider the current state of affairs
		in favor of a more just society. Advocacy also play a role in social services whereby we encourage 
		disadvantaged individuals to connect with available resources in order to increase 
standards of living and quality of life. My work as an advocate emphasizes both approaches.
