		<h2>Teaching and Mentoring</h2>
		<p>
			Intro to Ethics is a required course for at least three different 
			majors at UCSB (Phil., Econ. & Environmental Studies). Most of my 
				students are not Philosophy majors. This is the only course in 
				Philosophy they will ever take. For others, this is the gateway 
				course that could introduce them to years of intellectual 
				pursuits in Philosophy. On behalf of both kinds of students I ask:
				How do I teach so that my students can learn the material and take
				the lessons with them when they leave? 
				</br>
				</br>
				</p>
				<h3> Current Teaching Goals:</h3>
				<p>
				
				I am equipping myself with the tools necessary for effective 
				teaching in a Philosophy classroom. For myself, I'd like to learn 
				how to coordinate my section goals and outcomes with the specific 
				course requirements while still doing good Philosophy. For my 
				students, I'd like to build an inclusive classroom environment 
				where my students can really sit down and dig into philosophical 
				material, actively contribute to the discussion, and feel like 
				those contributions were taken seriously by the teacher and their 
				peers.
