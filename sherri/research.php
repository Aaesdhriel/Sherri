		<h4>Description</h4>
		<p>Most literature on blameworthiness focuses on agents who are blameworthy for their wrong acts versus agents who can 
		be excused from blame. I am interested in when it is appropriate to hold agents responsible for their wrong acts even if 
		they are not potential candidates for blame. The questions I want to answer are: "when is it appropriate to hold someone 
		responsible for her wrong act, even though she is not blameworthy?" and "when are we mistaken in judging that an agent is 
		blameworthy for performing some wrong act, even though she is morally responsible for performing it?" By asking these two 
		questions, I mean to identify a set of cases where agents are morally responsible but not blameworthy for performing wrong 
		acts.</p></br>

		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<p>In this paper, I examine the empirically-based folk concept of Praise-Blame Asymmetry. I note that when laypeople make 
		assessments of moral responsibility, they sometimes appeal to the agent’s motivations for acting, and they sometimes do not. 
		In order to figure out why they make these judgements and how these judgements are justified, I construct and explore an 
		empirically-based folk theory of moral worth. While examining the folk theory of moral worth, I realize that laypeople 
		inconsistently apply the criteria for an agent’s being morally responsible and that it is these inconsistently applied 
		criteria that are fuelling asymmetrical judgements about praiseworthiness and blameworthiness. I try to resolve the 
		inconsistencies in the folk theory of moral worth by appealing to the intend/foresee distinction and, eventually, by including 
		new criteria for ascriptions of moral responsibility: reasons for action. Believing that Nomy Arpaly’s theory of moral worth 
		can successfully support Praise-Blame Asymmetry; I flesh out her theory, hoping to resolve the inconsistencies and problems 
		that I noted in the original folk theory of moral worth. </p></br>

		<h4>Abstract</h4>
		<p>The purpose of this paper was to answer the question of whether morally indifferent agents are blameworthy when they 
		perform wrong acts. The answer to my question is that morally indifferent agents are not blameworthy when they perform wrong 
		acts, and that we are rarely, if ever, justified in considering them blameworthy. I answered this question by looking at 
		Nomy Arpaly’s theory of moral worth. I introduced Arpaly’s view with the praise-blame asymmetry in mind. Arpaly’s theory of 
		moral worth tracks the asymmetry and attempts to justify the actual asymmetrical judgments that we make when ascribing praise 
		and blame. I used Arpaly’s view as a vehicle for demonstrating how we go wrong when we claim that morally indifferent agents 
		are blameworthy when they perform wrong acts. To reach my conclusion, I determined that Arpaly thinks that it is a sufficient 
		condition for an agent’s being blameworthy that he is insufficiently responsive to the relevant moral reasons when he performs 
		a wrong act. In response, I showed that morally indifferent agents are not actually insufficiently responsive to relevant 
		moral reasons when they act, and that they are, thus, not blameworthy.</p></br>
