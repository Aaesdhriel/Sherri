		<h2>Action</h2>
		<p>
			Action is as important to Ethics as philosophical theory. To me, this means that I should spend as much time volunteering
and working in my community as I spend reading, writing, and teaching. On this page, I want to showcase some of the organizations 
that I have worked with since my time as an undergraduate at Wheaton.
