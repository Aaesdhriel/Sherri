			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
	
		<p>
		I am a graduate student in Philosophy and youth advocate. I am an active thinker and writer, willing to take on any subject. 
		I'm driven to participate in my community through active discussion and volunteerism. 
Hungry for new ideas, I am open to a diversity of perspectives and experiences that I can learn from and share.

	<ol> <li><h5>I am committed to <a href="teaching.php">Teaching</a>.</h5><br> 


 	   I am equipping myself with the tools necessary for effective 
				teaching in a Philosophy classroom. For myself, I'd like to learn 
				how to coordinate my section goals and outcomes with the specific 
				course requirements while still doing good Philosophy. For my 
				students, I'd like to build an inclusive classroom environment 
				where my students can really sit down and dig into philosophical 
				material, actively contribute to the discussion, and feel like 
				those contributions were taken seriously by the teacher and their 
				peers.</li><br><br>

	
	
	
	
<li><h5>I am committed to <a href="action.php">action</a>.</h5><br> 


 	   Action is as important to Ethics as philosophical theories. Basically, I think it is important for me to act on the ethical obligations I address as an academic. 
	   Otherwise, what are we doing this for?</li><br><br>

	   <p> 
 Diversity is inherent to human experience. It is important to embrace and share our diversity in order to
	   develop a more comprehensive understanding of our fellow man. As a survivor of childhood abuse and neglect, I am sensitive to 
	   issues of diversity in academia and look to incorporate a range of diverse perspectives in every academic discussion. Working 
	   with young people from communities that have been historically underrepresented in academia has given me access to a host of 
	   untempered voices boasting unique insights. I actively incorporate these insights into my professional and personal teaching and writing.
